  ## ðŸ’¬ First Project Differences/Advantages

  First Project : https://github.com/MehmetBozkir/React_Weather_App.git

1\. React Query:

-   React Query used instead of Axios:
    -   Reduced number of code lines.
    -   Eliminated the need for useEffect.
    -   Achieved a more readable code block.

2\. Key Generation:

-   uuid-npm used instead of looping through the API:
    -   Simpler and more error-free key generation.

3\. User Experience:

-   Loading screen added:
    -   Provides feedback to the user while data is loading.
    -   Improved user experience.

4\. Error Handling:

-   Made it easier to incorporate error messages into the flow:
    -   Errors are displayed to the user more clearly.

5\. Performance:

-   Reduced network traffic of the code:
    -   Data optimization achieved with fewer API requests.
    -   Performance increase achieved.

6\. API Call:

-   API call assigned to a button instead of directly calling and loading it:
    -   API requests are made more controllable.
    -   Unnecessary API requests are prevented.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
